<p>Three Questions<br />
It once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right<br />
time to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to<br />
listen to, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what<br />
was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything<br />
he might undertake.<br />
And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed<br />
throughout his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one<br />
who would teach him what was the right time for every action, and<br />
who were the most necessary people, and how he might know what was<br />
the most important thing to do.<br />
And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his<br />
questions differently.<br />
In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right<br />
time for every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days,<br />
months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only<br />
thus, said they, could everything be done at its proper time.<br />
Others declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the<br />
right time for every action; but that, not letting oneself be<br />
absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all that was<br />
going on, and then do what was most needful. Others, again, said<br />
that however attentive the King might be to what was going on, it<br />
was impossible for one man to decide correctly the right time for<br />
every action, but that he should have a Council of wise men, who<br />
would help him to fix the proper time for everything.<br />
But then again others said there were some things which could not<br />
wait to be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to<br />
decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide<br />
that, one must know beforehand what was going to happen. It is only<br />
magicians who know that; and, therefore, in order to know the right<br />
time for every action, one must consult magicians.<br />
Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said,<br />
the people the King most needed were his councillors; others, the<br />
priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the<br />
most necessary.<br />
To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:<br />
some replied that the most important thing in the world was science.<br />
Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was<br />
religious worship.<br />
All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them,<br />
and gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right<br />
answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely<br />
renowned for his wisdom.<br />
The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received<br />
none but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before<br />
reaching the hermit&#39;s cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving<br />
his body-guard behind, went on alone.<br />
When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front<br />
of his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging.<br />
The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into<br />
the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed heavily.<br />
The King went up to him and said: &quot;I have come to you, wise hermit,<br />
to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the<br />
right thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need, and<br />
to whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest?<br />
And, what affairs are the most important, and need my first attention?&quot;<br />
The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat<br />
on his hand and recommenced digging.<br />
&quot;You are tired,&quot; said the King, &quot;let me take the spade and work<br />
awhile for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he<br />
sat down on the ground.<br />
When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his<br />
questions. The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out<br />
his hand for the spade, and said:<br />
&quot;Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit.&quot;<br />
But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One<br />
hour passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees,<br />
and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:<br />
&quot;I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can<br />
give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Here comes some one running,&quot; said the hermit, &quot;let us see who it is.&quot;<br />
The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the<br />
wood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood<br />
was flowing from under them. When he reached the King, he fell<br />
fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit<br />
unfastened the man&#39;s clothing. There was a large wound in his<br />
stomach. The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged it with<br />
his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had. But the blood<br />
would not stop flowing, and the King again and again removed the<br />
bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the wound.<br />
When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked for<br />
something to drink. The King brought fresh water and gave it to<br />
him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool. So the<br />
King, with the hermit&#39;s help, carried the wounded man into the hut<br />
and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes<br />
and was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the<br />
work he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also<br />
fell asleep--so soundly that he slept all through the short summer<br />
night. When he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could<br />
remember where he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on<br />
the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.<br />
&quot;Forgive me!&quot; said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw<br />
that the King was awake and was looking at him.<br />
&quot;I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,&quot; said the King.<br />
&quot;You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who<br />
swore to revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother<br />
and seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the<br />
hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the day<br />
passed and you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to find<br />
you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me, and<br />
wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had<br />
you not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved<br />
my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your<br />
most faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!&quot;<br />
The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily,<br />
and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him,<br />
but said he would send his servants and his own physician to attend<br />
him, and promised to restore his property.<br />
Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the<br />
porch and looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished<br />
once more to beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit<br />
was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been<br />
dug the day before.<br />
The King approached him, and said:<br />
&quot;For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have already been answered!&quot; said the hermit, still crouching<br />
on his thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.<br />
&quot;How answered? What do you mean?&quot; asked the King.<br />
&quot;Do you not see,&quot; replied the hermit. &quot;If you had not pitied my<br />
weakness yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone<br />
your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have<br />
repented of not having stayed with me. So the most important time<br />
was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most important<br />
man; and to do me good was your most important business. Afterwards<br />
when that man ran to us, the most important time was when you were<br />
attending to him, for if you had not bound up his wounds he would<br />
have died without having made peace with you. So he was the most<br />
important man, and what you did for him was your most important<br />
business. Remember then: there is only one time that is important--<br />
Now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when<br />
we have any power. The most necessary man is he with whom you are,<br />
for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one<br />
else: and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for<br />
that purpose alone was man sent into this life!&quot;</p>





<p>MAKING WRITING SIMPLE<br />
BY J.B.PRIESTLEY<br />
At the end of a long talk with a youngish critic, a sincere fellow whose personality (though not his values) I respect, he stared at me and then slowly: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. Your talk is so much more complicated &ndash; subtle (noticeable) &ndash; than your writing. Your writing always seems to me too simple.&rsquo; And I replied: &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve spent years trying to make my writing simple. What you see as a fault, I regard as a virtue&rsquo;.<br />
There was now revealed to us the gulf between his generation and mine. He and his lot, matured in the early thirties, wanted literature to be difficult. They grew up in revolt against the Mass Communication antics of their age. They did not want to share anything with the crowd. Writing that was hard to understand was like a password to their secret society. A good writer to them was one who made his readers toil (hard work) and sweat. They admired extreme cleverness and solemnity (serious), poets like political cardinals, critics who came to literature like specialists summoned to consultation at a king&rsquo;s beside.<br />
A genuine author, an artist, as distinct from hacks who tried to please the mob, began with some simple thoughts and impressions and then proceeded to complicate his account of them, if only to keep away the fools. Difficulty was demanded, hence the vogue (fashion) to Donne and Hopkins. Literature had to respond to something twisted, tormented, and esoteric (unusual), in their own secret natures. In all this there was no pose and here their elders went wrong about them. They could be accused not unjustly of narrowness and arrogance, but not of insincerity. They were desperately sincere in believing that the true artist must hide from the crowd behind a thicket (dense) of briers. They grew up terrified of the crowd, who in this new Mass Age seemed to them to be threatening all decent values.&nbsp;<br />
But I was born in the Nineteenth century and my most impressionable years were those just before 1914. Rightly or wrongly, I am not afraid of the crowd. And art to me is not synonymous with introversion. (I regard this as the great critical fallacy of our time). Because I am what is called &lsquo;an intellectual&rsquo;&mdash;and I am just as much &lsquo;an intellectual&rsquo; as these younger chaps&mdash;I do not feel that there is a glass wall between me and the people in the nearest factories, shops and pubs. I prefer therefore a wide channel of communications. Deliberately I aim at simplicity and not complexity in my writing. No matter what the subject in hand might be, I want to write something that a pinch I could read aloud in a bar-parlour. (And the time came when I was heard and understood in a thousand bar-parlours).<br />
I do not pretend to be subtle and profound, but when I am at work I try to appear simpler than I really am. Perhaps I make it too easy for the reader, do too much of the toiling and sweating myself. No doubt I am altogether too obvious for the cleverest fellows, who want to beat their brains against something hard and knotty. But then I am not impressed by this view of literature as a cerebral activity.<br />
Some contemporary critics would be better occupied solving chess problems and breaking down cyphers. They are no customers of mine, and I do not display my goods to catch. But any man who thinks the kind of simplicity I attempt is easy should try it for himself, if only in his next letter to The Times. I find it much easier now than I used to do but that is because I have kept this aim in view throughout years of hard work. I do not claim to have achieved even now a prose that is like an easy persuasive voice, preferably my own at its best; but this is what I have been trying to do for years, quite deliberately, and it is this that puzzled my friend, the youngish critic who cannot help wanting something quite different.&nbsp;<br />
This habit of simplification has its own little triumphs. Thus, I was asked to pay a birthday tribute, on the air, to C. G. Jung, for whose work and personality I have massive admiration. To explain Jung in thirteen and a half minutes so that the ordinary listener could understand what the fuss was about! My friends said it could not be done. The psychologists said it could not be done. But I can reasonably claim, backed by first class evidence, that I did it. It was a tough little task, but when I had come to the end of it I found, like honey in the rock, a taste of delight.&nbsp;<br />

<p>How to Speak Correct English<br />
By Bernard Shaw<br />
Let me introduce myself, Bernard Shaw.&nbsp;<br />
I am asked to give you a specimen of spoken English. But first let me give you a warning. You think you are hearing my voice. But unless you know how to use your gramophone properly, what you are hearing maybe grotesquely unlike any sound that has ever come from my lips.&nbsp;<br />
A few days ago I heard a gramophone record of a speech by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, the parliamentary chief of the British Labour Party, who has a fine deep Scottish voice and a remarkably musical and dignified delivery. What I heard was a high pitched, sharp, cackling voice, most unmusical, suggesting a small, egotistical, very ill mannered man, complaining of something. I said, &quot;That is not Mr. MacDonald, I know his voice as well as I know my own.&quot; The gramophone operator assured me that it was and showed me the label on the record to prove it. I said, &quot;No, that is not Ramsay MacDonald. But let me see whether I cannot find him for you.&quot; Then, as the record started again, I took the screw, which regulates the speed, and slowed the record down gradually until the high pitched yapping changed to the deep tones of Mr. MacDonald&#39;s voice. And the unmusical, quarrelsome self-assertion became the melodious rhetoric of the Scottish orator. &quot;There,&quot; I said, &quot;that is Mr. MacDonald.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
So you see what you are hearing now is not my voice unless your gramophone is turning at exactly the right speed. I have records of famous singers and speakers who are dead; but whose voices I can remember quite well: Adelina Patti, Sarah Bernard, Charles Santley, Caruso, Tamagno. But they sound quite horrible and silly until I have found the right speed for them as I found it for Mr. MacDonalds.&nbsp;<br />
Now the worst of it is that I cannot tell you how to find the right speed for me. Those of you, who have heard me speak, either face to face with me or over the wireless, will have no difficulty. You have just to change the speed until you recognize the voice you remember. But what are you to do, if you have never heard me? Well, I can give you a hint that will help you. If what you hear is very disappointing and you feel instinctively, that must be a horrid man, you may be quite sure the speed is wrong. Slow it down, until you feel that you are listening to an amiable old gentleman of 71 with a rather pleasant Irish voice. Then that is me. All the other people, whom you hear at the other speeds, are impostors, sham Shaws, phantoms who never existed.&nbsp;<br />
I am now going to suppose that you are a foreign student of the English language, and that you desire to speak it well enough to be understood when you travel in the British Commonwealth or in America or when you meet a native of those countries. Or it may be that you are yourself a native, but that you speak in a provincial or Cockney dialect of which you are a little ashamed or which perhaps prevents you from obtaining some employment, which is open to those only who speak what is called correct English.&nbsp;<br />
Now whether you are a foreigner or a native the first thing I must impress on you is that there is no such thing as ideally correct English. No two British subjects speak exactly alike.&nbsp;<br />
I am a member of a committee established by the British Broadcasting Corporation, for the purpose of deciding how the utterances of speakers employed by the corporation should be pronounced, in order that they should be a model of correct English speech for the British islands.&nbsp;<br />
All the members of that committee are educated persons, whose speech would pass as correct and refined in any society or any employment in London. Our chairman is the poet laureate who is not only an artist, whose materials are the sounds of spoken English, but a specialist in their pronunciation. One of our members is Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson, famous not only as an actor, but for the beauty of his speech. I was selected for service on the committee because as a writer of plays I am accustomed to superintend their rehearsals. And to listen critically to the way in which they are spoken by actors who are by profession trained speakers, being myself a public speaker of long experience.&nbsp;<br />
That committee knows as much as anyone knows about English speech. And yet its members do not agree as to the pronunciation of some of the simplest and commonest words in the English language.&nbsp;<br />
The two simplest and commonest words in any language are yes and no. But no two members of the committee pronounce them exactly alike. All that can be said is that every member pronounces them in such a way that they would not only be intelligible in every English speaking country, but would stamp the speaker as a cultivated person, as distinguished from an ignorant and illiterate one.&nbsp;<br />
You will say, &quot;Well, that is good enough for me. That is how I desire to speak.&quot; But which member of the committee will you take for your model? There are Irish members, Scottish members, Welsh members, Oxford University members, American members. All recognizable as such by their differences of speech. They differ also according to the country in which they were born. Now as they all speak differently it is nonsense to say that they all speak correctly. All we can claim is that they all speak presentably. And if you speak as they do you will be understood in any English speaking country and accepted as a person of good social standing.&nbsp;<br />
I wish I could offer you your choice among them all as a model. But for the moment I am afraid you must put up with me, an Irish man.&nbsp;<br />
I have said enough to you about the fact that no two native speakers of English speak it alike. But perhaps you are clever enough to ask me whether I myself always speak it in the same way. I must confess at once that I do not. Nobody does.&nbsp;<br />
I am at present speaking to an audience of many thousands of gramophone listeners. Many of whom are trying hard to follow my words syllable by syllable. If I were to speak to you as carelessly as I speak to my wife at home this record would be useless. And if I were to speak to my wife at home as carefully as I am speaking to you she would think that I was going mad. As a public speaker I have to take care that every word I say is heard distinct fully at the far end of large halls containing thousands of people.&nbsp;<br />
But at home, when I have to consider only my wife sitting within six feet of me at breakfast, I take so little pains with my speech, that very often, instead of giving me the expected answer, she says, &quot;Don&#39;t mumble and don&#39;t turn your head away when you speak. I can&#39;t hear a word you are saying&quot;. And she also is a little careless. Sometimes I have to say, &quot;What?&quot; two or three times during our meal. And she suspects me of growing deafer and deafer. So she does not say so, because as I am now over 70 it might be true. No doubt I ought to speak to my wife as carefully as I should speak to a queen and she to me as carefully as she would speak to a king. We ought to, but we don&#39;t. Don&#39;t by the way is short for do not.&nbsp;<br />
We all have company manners and home manners. If you were to call on a strange family and to listen through the key hole, not that I would suggest for a moment that you are capable doing of such a very unladylike or ungentlemanlike thing. But still, if in your enthusiasm for studying languages you could bring yourself to do it, just for a few seconds to hear how a family speaks to one another, when there is nobody else listening to them, and then walk into the room and hear how very differently they speak in your presence, the change would surprise you.&nbsp;<br />
Even when our home manners are as good as our company manners, and of course they ought to be much better, they are always different. And the difference is greater in speech than in anything else.&nbsp;<br />
Suppose I forget to wind my watch and it stops. I have to ask somebody to tell me the time. If I ask a stranger I say, &quot;What o&#39;clock is it?&quot; The stranger hears every syllable distinctly. But if I ask my wife all she hears is &quot;Clock&#39;s it&quot;. That is good enough for her, but it would not be good enough for you.&nbsp;<br />
So I am speaking to you now much more carefully than I speak to her. But please don&#39;t tell her.&nbsp;<br />
I am now going to address myself especially to my foreign hearers. I have to give them another warning of quite a different type. If you are learning English, because you intend to travel in England and wish to be understood there do not try to speak English perfectly. Because if you do no one will understand you.&nbsp;<br />
I have already explained that &#39;though there is no such thing as perfectly correct English, there is presentable English, which we call good English. But in London 999 out of every thousand people not only speak bad English, but speak even that very badly. You may say, that even if they do not speak English well themselves, they can at least understand it when it is well spoken. They can when the speaker is English. But when the speaker is a foreigner, the better he speaks, the harder it is to understand him.&nbsp;<br />
No foreigner can ever stress the syllables and make the voice rise and fall in question and answer, assertion and denial, in refusal and consent, in inquiry or information, exactly as a native does. Therefore the first thing you have to do is to speak with a strong foreign accent and speak broken English. That is English without any grammar. Then every English person, to whom you speak, will at once know that you are a foreigner and try to understand you and be ready to help you. He will not expect you to be polite and to use elaborate grammatical phrases. He will be interested in you, because you are a foreigner and pleased by his own cleverness in making out your meaning and being able to tell you what you want to know.&nbsp;<br />
If you say, &quot;Will you have the goodness, sir, to direct me to the railway terminus at Charing Cross,&quot; pronouncing all the vowels and consonants beautifully, he will not understand you. And will suspect you of being a beggar or a confidence trickster. But if you shout, &quot;Please, Charing Cross, which way?&quot; you will have no difficulty. Half a dozen people will immediately overwhelm you with directions. Even in private intercourse with cultivated people you must not speak too well.&nbsp;<br />
Apply this to your attempts to learn foreign languages and never try to speak them too well. And do not be afraid to travel, you will be surprised to find out how little you need to know or how badly you may pronounce. Even among English people to speak too well is a pedantic affectation. In a foreigner it is something worse than an affectation; it is an insult to the native who cannot understand his own language when it is too well spoken.&nbsp;<br />
That is all I can tell you. The record will hold no more. Good bye.&nbsp;<br />
.....&nbsp;<br />
This speech was recorded in 1927.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OF STUDIES<br />
By Francis Bacon<br />
Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the humor of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning (trimming), by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men condemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer (talk) little, he had need have a present wit: and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not. Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle (fine); natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend (argue). Abeunt studia in mores [Studies pass into and influence manners]. Nay, there is no stond (stand) or impediment (barrier) in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies; like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises. Bowling is good for the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and breast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for the head; and the like. So if a man&rsquo;s wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he must begin again. If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let him study the Schoolmen; for they are cymini sectores [splitters of hairs]. If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study the lawyers&rsquo; cases. So every defect of the mind may have a special receipt.<br />
