<p>Three Questions<br />
It once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right<br />
time to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to<br />
listen to, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what<br />
was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything<br />
he might undertake.<br />
And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed<br />
throughout his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one<br />
who would teach him what was the right time for every action, and<br />
who were the most necessary people, and how he might know what was<br />
the most important thing to do.<br />
And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his<br />
questions differently.<br />
In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right<br />
time for every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days,<br />
months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only<br />
thus, said they, could everything be done at its proper time.<br />
Others declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the<br />
right time for every action; but that, not letting oneself be<br />
absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all that was<br />
going on, and then do what was most needful. Others, again, said<br />
that however attentive the King might be to what was going on, it<br />
was impossible for one man to decide correctly the right time for<br />
every action, but that he should have a Council of wise men, who<br />
would help him to fix the proper time for everything.<br />
But then again others said there were some things which could not<br />
wait to be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to<br />
decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide<br />
that, one must know beforehand what was going to happen. It is only<br />
magicians who know that; and, therefore, in order to know the right<br />
time for every action, one must consult magicians.<br />
Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said,<br />
the people the King most needed were his councillors; others, the<br />
priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the<br />
most necessary.<br />
To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:<br />
some replied that the most important thing in the world was science.<br />
Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was<br />
religious worship.<br />
All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them,<br />
and gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right<br />
answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely<br />
renowned for his wisdom.<br />
The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received<br />
none but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before<br />
reaching the hermit&#39;s cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving<br />
his body-guard behind, went on alone.<br />
When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front<br />
of his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging.<br />
The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into<br />
the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed heavily.<br />
The King went up to him and said: &quot;I have come to you, wise hermit,<br />
to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the<br />
right thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need, and<br />
to whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest?<br />
And, what affairs are the most important, and need my first attention?&quot;<br />
The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat<br />
on his hand and recommenced digging.<br />
&quot;You are tired,&quot; said the King, &quot;let me take the spade and work<br />
awhile for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he<br />
sat down on the ground.<br />
When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his<br />
questions. The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out<br />
his hand for the spade, and said:<br />
&quot;Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit.&quot;<br />
But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One<br />
hour passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees,<br />
and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:<br />
&quot;I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can<br />
give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Here comes some one running,&quot; said the hermit, &quot;let us see who it is.&quot;<br />
The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the<br />
wood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood<br />
was flowing from under them. When he reached the King, he fell<br />
fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit<br />
unfastened the man&#39;s clothing. There was a large wound in his<br />
stomach. The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged it with<br />
his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had. But the blood<br />
would not stop flowing, and the King again and again removed the<br />
bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the wound.<br />
When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked for<br />
something to drink. The King brought fresh water and gave it to<br />
him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool. So the<br />
King, with the hermit&#39;s help, carried the wounded man into the hut<br />
and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes<br />
and was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the<br />
work he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also<br />
fell asleep--so soundly that he slept all through the short summer<br />
night. When he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could<br />
remember where he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on<br />
the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.<br />
&quot;Forgive me!&quot; said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw<br />
that the King was awake and was looking at him.<br />
&quot;I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,&quot; said the King.<br />
&quot;You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who<br />
swore to revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother<br />
and seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the<br />
hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the day<br />
passed and you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to find<br />
you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me, and<br />
wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had<br />
you not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved<br />
my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your<br />
most faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!&quot;<br />
The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily,<br />
and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him,<br />
but said he would send his servants and his own physician to attend<br />
him, and promised to restore his property.<br />
Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the<br />
porch and looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished<br />
once more to beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit<br />
was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been<br />
dug the day before.<br />
The King approached him, and said:<br />
&quot;For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have already been answered!&quot; said the hermit, still crouching<br />
on his thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.<br />
&quot;How answered? What do you mean?&quot; asked the King.<br />
&quot;Do you not see,&quot; replied the hermit. &quot;If you had not pitied my<br />
weakness yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone<br />
your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have<br />
repented of not having stayed with me. So the most important time<br />
was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most important<br />
man; and to do me good was your most important business. Afterwards<br />
when that man ran to us, the most important time was when you were<br />
attending to him, for if you had not bound up his wounds he would<br />
have died without having made peace with you. So he was the most<br />
important man, and what you did for him was your most important<br />
business. Remember then: there is only one time that is important--<br />
Now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when<br />
we have any power. The most necessary man is he with whom you are,<br />
for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one<br />
else: and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for<br />
that purpose alone was man sent into this life!&quot;</p>
