Recently you invented a brand-new definition of prime numbers. For a given set of positive 
integers S let's call X a prime if there are no elements in S which are divisors of X 
(except X itself).You are given a set S. Find elements in it which are prime numbers for 
this set.The first line contains one integer N - size of the set S. The second line contains
N space-separated integers - elements of S. All the numbers are pairwise different.
Output one line: elements of S which are prime numbers for this set in the order they occur
in the input. Separate them by whitespaces.

Bacially in this problem we are given a set of numbers and we have to tell the primes in that set.
Now s[i] is a prime if its divided by itself and no other number present in the set S.
