Basically the problem was as follows :-

Chandan gave his son a cube with side N. The N X N X N cube is made up of small 1 X 1 X 1 cubes.Chandan's son is extremely notorious just like him. 
So he dropped the cube inside a tank filled with Coke. The cube got totally immersed in that tank. His son was somehow able to take out the cube from 
the tank.But sooner his son realized that the cube had gone all dirty because of the coke. Since Chandan did not like dirty stuffs ,
so his son decided to scrap off all the smaller cubes that got dirty in the process. A cube that had coke on any one of its six faces was 
considered to be dirty and scrapped off. After completing this cumbersome part his son decided to calculate volume of the scrapped off material. 
Since Chandan's son is weak in maths he is unable to do it alone.Help him in calculating the required volume.

and,this is how i approached it,I used c++ programming language as i am comfortable with it you can use any language you are comfortable with
.One of the major problem that i faced was that i wasn't keeping the constraints in my mind ,
and when i was submitting it was generating an error,irrespective of that fact the my answer was correct.
Later on i realised my mistake and then updated the my code and VOLA .. everything is chill.
